# WordPress Custom Validation & Submission Dashboard ✅

This project is a **custom PHP + WordPress-compatible** application. It connects with your WordPress site to manage form submissions externally — ideal for verifying participants or applicants before confirming them.

---

## 📌 What It Does

- 📝 **Collects Submissions**  
  Receives form data (e.g., from Forminator) and stores it securely.

- 👨‍⚖️ **Manual Validation Dashboard**  
  View all submissions and manually validate or reject them.

- 📧 **Send Email Notifications**  
  - ✅ **Validation Email** for approved users  
  - ❌ **Rejection Email** for those not accepted  

- 🗑️ **Delete Submissions**  
  Clean up old or invalid entries with a single click.

- 📊 **Live Statistics**  
  - Total submissions  
  - Number of validated and non-validated users  
  - Real-time dashboard for admins

---

## 💡 How It Works

1. A WordPress form (like **Forminator**) is configured to send data via webhook or API to the subdomain.
2. Submissions are saved in a custom database table.
3. Admins log into the dashboard to:
   - View new entries  
   - Validate or reject each one  
   - Automatically send the corresponding email  
4. Dashboard displays live stats of all validations.
